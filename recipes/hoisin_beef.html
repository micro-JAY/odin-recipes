    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The (underrated) hoisin sauce is a thickened, fermented soy-sauce-like substance, flavored with chilies, 
        garlic, vinegar, sugar, and, of course, exotic spices. It makes a great marinade. 
        And unless you horribly overcook it, this skirt steak is juicy and tender.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 pound) beef skirt steak</li>
        <li>⅓ cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Chinese vinegar (or sherry vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 green onion, light parts only, minced</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk hoisin sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, hot sauce, sesame oil, grated ginger, garlic, brown sugar, salt, 
            and pepper together in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut skirt steak crosswise into about 4 or 5 smaller pieces. Transfer steak into marinade and toss until 
            all pieces are evenly coated. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate; marinate at least 2 hours and up 
            to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Line a baking pan with paper towels. Transfer pieces of steak to the paper towels and mop off some of 
            the marinade.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak pieces to grill. Cook to medium rare or medium, 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 130 and 135 degrees F 
            (about 54 degrees C). Thinner pieces might finish earlier. Transfer steak to a warm plate. 
            Let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a warm serving platter and pour any accumulated juices over skirt steak. 
            Sprinkle with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
